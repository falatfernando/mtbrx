# MtbRx - Genomic Resistance Explorer

MtbRx is a web-based genomic explorer for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, designed to bridge the gap between complex genomic data and clinical drug resistance interpretation. Built with Python Dash, it provides researchers and clinicians with an integrated platform to visualize genomic regions, calculate variant coordinates, and cross-reference mutations with the official WHO drug resistance catalogue. This app has it's on [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1199917151.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21035590) and a free hosted version is available at [Render](https://tbdashboard.onrender.com/).
***Note: the free Render instance may take 30-60 seconds to wake up on first load.***

## Features

- **Multimodal Search**: One box accepts three query formats, and `Enter` submits:
  - Locus tag / gene ID — `Rv0677c`
  - Gene name / symbol — `mmpS5`
  - Variant — `katG_Ser315Thr` (three-letter notation; `katG_S315T` is accepted and normalised)
- **Variant Deep Linking**: Searching a variant loads the gene *and* selects, highlights and pages to that mutation in the resistance and coordinate tables
- **Gene Neighbourhood Track**: An interactive prokaryotic track — click any neighbouring gene to load it, hover for gene symbol, locus tag, product and functional note
- **Genomic Visualization**: Embedded JBrowse 2 view of the region
- **Drug Resistance Profiles**: The full WHO catalogue schema — mutation, tier, final confidence grading, effect, comment, `CHANGES vs ver1`, relaxed-thresholds simulation and silent-mutation flag, with a column-visibility control
- **Coordinate Calculator**: Automatically convert between:
  - Genomic coordinates (absolute position on chromosome)
  - Gene-relative coordinates (c. notation, e.g., c.102G>A)
  - Amino acid positions (p. notation, e.g., p.Asp3Ala)
- **Sequence Retrieval**: Coding sequence, protein translation, and adjustable upstream/downstream flanks (default ±500 bp), with copy-to-clipboard
- **Browse by Drug**: Start from a drug name and jump to any of its catalogue genes
- **Catalogue Summary**: Per-gene and per-drug counts by tier, confidence grading and loss of function, with aggregate totals
- **Drill-down Details**: Explore all nucleotide changes for each mutation, including multi-kilobase indel alleles

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Create virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Verify data files**:
Ensure the following files exist in the `data/` directory:
- `h37rv.gff3` - Genome annotation file
- `h37rv.fasta` - Reference genome sequence
- `h37rv.fasta.fai` - FASTA index file
- `catalogue_master_file.txt` - WHO drug resistance catalogue
- `genomic_coordinates.txt` - Mutation coordinates

## Running Tests

To run the automated tests, ensure you have installed the dependencies (including `pytest`), and execute the following command from the root directory:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8050`

### Quick Start

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8050`
2. Search by gene name (`katG`), locus tag (`Rv1908c`) or variant (`katG_Ser315Thr`)
3. Click the search button or press `Enter`
4. Explore the results:
   - **Gene Info**: Genomic coordinates, strand, length in bp and amino acids, functional note
   - **Gene Neighbourhood**: Clickable track of the surrounding genes
   - **Genomic Visualization**: JBrowse view of the region
   - **Sequence Retrieval**: CDS, protein and flanking sequence
   - **Drug Resistance**: Associated drugs, tiers and WHO confidence gradings
   - **Genomic Coordinates**: All nucleotide changes
   - **Coordinate Analysis**: Detailed position calculations for the selected mutation

Alternatively, use **Browse by Drug** in the header to reach a gene from a drug
name, or **Catalogue Summary** for counts across the whole dataset.

### A note on prokaryotic annotation

*M. tuberculosis* is a bacterium: it has no splicing, and a coding sequence is
equivalent to its gene. The annotation handed to the genome browser is
therefore flattened to a single gene-level feature per locus, which removes
both the redundant gene/CDS pair and every intron-based control from the
browser's sequence tools. Protein translation and flanking-sequence retrieval
are provided by the **Sequence Retrieval** panel instead.

### Coordinate Calculation Feature

The application automatically calculates the relationship between:

- **Genomic Position**: Absolute position on the chromosome (e.g., position 8 on NC_000962.3)
- **Gene Relative Position**: Position relative to gene start (e.g., c.7 for dnaA)
- **Amino Acid Position**: Codon position in the protein (e.g., p.Asp3)

#### Example Calculation

For `dnaA_p.Asp3Ala`:
```
Gene: dnaA
  - Genomic coordinates: NC_000962.3:1-1524 (+ strand)
  - Gene start: 1
  
Mutation: p.Asp3Ala (Aspartic acid → Alanine at amino acid position 3)
  - Amino acid position: 3
  - Nucleotide position (relative): (3-1) × 3 + 1 = 7
  - Genomic position: 1 + 7 - 1 = 7
  
Result: The mutation is at genomic position 7, which is c.7 in HGVS notation
```

For genes on the **minus strand**, the calculation is reversed:
```
Gene on - strand:
  - Genomic position = Gene end - Relative position + 1
```

## Data Sources

- **H37Rv Reference Genome**: NC_000962.3
- **GFF3 Annotation**: RefSeq annotations via NCBI
- **Drug Resistance Catalogue**: [WHO Catalogue (2023) second edition](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082410) for *M. tuberculosis* drug resistance.

### DataLoader Class

```python
from data_utils import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader(data_dir="data")
loader.load_gff3()
loader.load_catalogue()
loader.load_genomic_coordinates()

# Get gene information
gene_info = loader.get_gene_info("dnaA")

# Search for mutations
mutations = loader.search_mutations_by_gene("dnaA")

# Get drug resistance info
resistance = loader.get_drug_resistance_info("dnaA")
```

### CoordinateCalculator Class

```python
from coordinate_calculator import CoordinateCalculator

calc = CoordinateCalculator(data_loader)

# Calculate all coordinates for a variant
result = calc.calculate_full_coordinates("dnaA_c.102G>A", "dnaA")
# Returns: {
#   'variant': 'dnaA_c.102G>A',
#   'gene': 'dnaA',
#   'gene_info': {...},
#   'mutation': 'c.102G>A',
#   'relative_nucleotide_position': 102,
#   'genomic_position': ...,
#   'amino_acid_position': ...
# }

# Get complete mutation information
mutation_info = calc.get_mutation_with_coordinates(
    variant="dnaA_c.102G>A",
    gene_name="dnaA",
    drug="Amikacin"
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Gene not found" error**:
   - Check that the GFF3 file is properly loaded
   - Try using the locus tag instead of gene name (e.g., `Rv0001` for `dnaA`)

2. **JBrowse not displaying**:
   - Ensure the GFF3 file path is correct
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify that dash-jbrowse is properly installed

3. **Slow performance**:
   - The catalogue file is large (~35MB), initial load may take time
   - Consider filtering data for specific drugs/genes

### Debug Mode

Run with debug output:
```bash
python app.py
# Check console for error messages
```

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Export results to PDF/Excel
- [ ] Batch search for multiple genes/mutations
